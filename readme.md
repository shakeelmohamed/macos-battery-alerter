# MacOS battery alerter

When your MacOS battery is below x percentage, you'll receive a more obvious alert than the default one in notification center.

ðŸš¨This is a work in progress.ðŸš¨

TODOs:

* make alert more obtrusive (hijack window focus)
* * predict remaining battery life in minute
* make threshold configurable
* configurable audible alert
* pleasant UI
* configurable for startup?
* custom app icon
* cross platform support?
